Dynamic Geometry in Elm
=======================

A simple dynamic geometry program in the functional programming language [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). 
This is a project I chose as part of a [lecture course](http://www.janis-voigtlaender.eu/teaching/ffp14/) at university. 

You can **try it out** [here](http://fanzier.github.io/elm-geometry).

The current functionality is quite basic but allows you to construct any points constructible using a [compass and a straightedge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass-and-straightedge_construction), the tools used in classical geometry. However it lacks some features you might expect in a geometry program, such as hiding auxiliary lines and circles, measuring lengths and angles etc.
